Requires Tensorflow version 1.9. See requirements.txt for details

#### Data Preprocessing:
First download/extract the [UMLS](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/licensedcontent/umlsknowledgesources.html). 
This project assumes the UMLS files are laid out as such:
    ```
    <UMLS_DIR>/
        META/
            MRCONSO.RRF
            MRSTY.RRF
        NET/
            SRSTRE1
    ```
